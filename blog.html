      <h2 class="text-2xl">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl">1. var</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Function Scope:Variables declared with var have function scope,
          meaning they are accessible anywhere within the function in which they
          are declared.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hoisting: Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their
          containing function or global scope. This means you can access a var
          variable before it's declared, but it will be undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          No Block Scope: Unlike let and const, var variables are not
          block-scoped. This means they can "leak" out of if statements, loops,
          and other block structures.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl">2. let</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Block Scope: Variables declared with let have block scope, meaning
          they are accessible only within the block in which they are defined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Hoisting: Like var, let variables are hoisted but are not initialized.
          Trying to access a let variable before its declaration will result in
          a ReferenceError.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl">3. const</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Block Scope: Variables declared with const also have block scope, just
          like let.
        </li>
        <li>
          Constant Value: const variables are used for values that should not be
          reassigned after declaration. While the variable itself is immutable,
          the content of objects and arrays declared with const can still be
          modified.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-2xl">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h2>
      <h3 class="text-xl">1. undefined</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Default Value: Variables that are declared but not initialized or
          don't have a value assigned to them are automatically set to
          undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Function Parameters: When a function is called with fewer arguments
          than declared parameters, the missing parameters are assigned the
          value undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Object Properties: If you try to access an object property that
          doesn't exist, JavaScript returns undefined.
        </li>
        <li>
          Return Value: If a function doesn't explicitly return a value, it
          implicitly returns undefined.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl">2. null</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Explicit Absence of Value: null is explicitly assigned to a variable
          or property to indicate the absence of a value. It is often used when
          you want to represent that a variable should have no value or that an
          object property should be empty.
        </li>
        <li>
          Comparison with undefined: null is sometimes used when you want to
          distinguish between the absence of a value (null) and a variable not
          being defined or initialized (undefined).
        </li>
        <li>
          Clearing Object Properties: You can set an object property to null to
          indicate that it should be empty or cleared.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="text-2xl">What do you mean by REST API?</h2>
      <p>
        A REST API is a way for computers (like websites and apps) to talk to
        each other over the internet. It's like a menu in a restaurant. The menu
        tells you what dishes are available and what you can do with them (like
        order, update, or delete). Here's a simple breakdown:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Menu: The API has a list of things you can do (like "get data" or "add
          data"). Each thing you can do is like an item on the menu.
        </li>

        <li>
          Orders: When you want to do something, you send a request to the API,
          just like ordering food from a menu.
        </li>

        <li>
          Dishes: The API gives you the data or performs the action you asked
          for, just like how the restaurant gives you the food you ordered.
        </li>

        <li>
          Waiter: The API is like a waiter who takes your order (request) and
          brings you what you asked for (response).
        </li>

        <li>
          Table: The internet is like a big restaurant with many tables
          (computers). REST APIs help tables (computers) communicate with each
          other by following a set of rules.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In summary, a REST API is like a menu for computers on the internet,
        allowing them to order and exchange information in a structured way.
        It's a way for different programs to talk to each other and share data.
